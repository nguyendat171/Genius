# FrontEnd Genius - Quoc Dat Nguyen.

## Overview

This is the test for FrontEnd Genius.

##### Frontend:

Typescript, React, ESlint, Prettier, Redux with [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/).
Bootstrap, SASS.

## Extra works

1. Style Guide page

It's important for the team to have an overview of our design system.

2. Clean code structure and lint tools.

Code quality is quite important for a long term project. Setup `ESlint` or other lint tools would help a lot.

## Bonus parts

1. Implemented React Hooks: `useStateSelector`, `useStateDispatch`
2. Used Redux to manage state.
3. Implemented unit tests by using jest. (`$ npm run test`)
4. Used SASS as a CSS Preprocessor for app's style.

# Todo if having free time

1. Add login feature.
2. UI home page.
3. Write more unit tests.
